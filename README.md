### Hi there 👋

My name is Ismael Oliveira from Brazil (🇧🇷). I graduated in computer engineering from Inatel in 2017 and I've been studied development Front-End  and a little Back-End since. Currently I'm doing a Postgraduate of [Development Web Full Stack - PUC Minas](https://www.pucminas.br/PucVirtual/Pos-Graduacao/Paginas/Desenvolvimento-Web-Full-Stack.aspx?moda=1&polo=1&area=11&curso=2967&situ=1).

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), running (🏃), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺) and eventually I like to think about future.

Would you like to find me?
